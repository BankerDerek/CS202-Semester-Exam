<b><u>Challenges</u></b>
    <p>
    One challange was figuring out how to get the header data into the vector formatt we needed for our classes.<br>>
    Another challenge was not overwritting group members files on git hub. The solution for this was to communicate which<br>
    files each group member was working on so the other people avoided editing those files.<br>

<b><u>Instructions</u></b>
    <p>
    Nothing beyond make is required for building the Application.<br>
